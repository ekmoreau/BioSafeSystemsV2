                </h3>
                <p>AXXE Broad Spectrum Herbicide is a soap product that penetrates the cell walls of plants. This will disrupt the cellular organization of physiological functions that are compartmentalized by membranes within the cell walls. Plant growth ceases when cellular contents are mixed, which causes brown necrotic plant tissue.</p>

                <p class="preheader mb--none">Vegetative Burndown</p>

                <p class="preheader mb--none">Preemergence Spray</p>
                <p class="small">Broadcast or strip applications before seeds germinate and emerge, and before perennial plants, tubers, bulbs or seed pieces sprout and emerge.</p>
                <p class="preheader mb--none">Industrial and Building Uses</p>
                <p class="small">Apply to weeds in walkways, driveways, parking areas and around buildings or structures. Broadcast or spot sprays may be applied to open field areas and rights-of-way.</p>

                <p class="small">Spray nozzle type or configuration for directed spray or a shield placed around the nozzle to prevent spray contact on the foliage or green stems or back. Use directed/shielded spray applications to the area between plastic mulch strips and staked crops for weed control.</p>
                <p class="preheader mb--none">Dormant or Post Harvest Spray</p>
                <p class="small">Apply after crops are harvested to kill broadleaf weeds and grasses and residual green growth of the crop plants. Apply to dormant crops such as alfalfa or turf.</p>
