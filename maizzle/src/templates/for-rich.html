                      <p class="m-0 mb-24 text-lg leading-21">This notification is to advise you that BioSafe Systems will be implementing a temporary shipping surcharge for all orders placed on or after June 1, 2021.  As you are likely aware, freight costs have been increasing over the last 6 months and there is a national lumber shortage driving up the cost of pallets.  BioSafe has been able to absorb these costs to date and minimize the impact to you.</p>

                        <p class="m-0 mb-8 text-bioBlue text-lg font-semibold leading-21">GOING FORWARD FREIGHT AND PALLET SURCHARGES WILL BE ASSESSED AS FOLLOWS:</p>

                        <p class="m-0 mb-12 text-lg leading-21">&bull; Shipped wooden pallet - $50 per pallet<br> &bull; Customer Pick-up wooden pallet - $20 per pallet</p>

                        <p class="m-0 mb-0 text-lg leading-21">&bull; Shipped 275 or 330 gallon tote - $30 per tote<br> &bull; Customer Pick-up of 275 or 330 gallon tote â€“ No charge</p>
                      </div>

                      <p class="m-0 mb-12 text-lg leading-21">These surcharges are temporary until such time as costs recover to normal levels.</p>
                      <p class="m-0 mb-24 text-lg leading-21">Orders received prior to June 1, 2021 will not incur a surcharge.</p>
                      <p class="m-0 mb-24 text-lg leading-21">We appreciate your business and if you have any questions, please reach out to our Customer Relations team at <a class="text-bioBlue font-semibold no-underline" href="tel:+18602908890">(860) 290-8890</a> or email at <a class="text-bioBlue font-semibold no-underline" href="mailto:customerrelations@biosafesystems.com">CustomerRelations@BioSafeSystems.com</a>.</p>
